# Aplhabetical
### Quiz game where players must answer a set of questions based on the letters of the alphabet!

## Topics involved:
- Binary search trees
- Circular linked lists
- Pointers
- File handling
- Struct implementation

## Steps to get started:
**Prerequisites:** It will be needed for you to download the files present in the repo and save them in the same directory.

**Windows:** An .exe file is included in the repo so you can run the program directly, you are welcome :)  
**Linux & Mac:** If you are using Linux or Mac(showoff... just kidding), the .exe file wonÂ´t work for you, and a few extra steps will be needed:
- To compile the program you must download either an IDE or a (surprise) compiler:
  - I recommend [code::blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) as it is a complete and lightweigh IDE which will serve you just fine, but feel free to use any other ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for Mac are also good ideas).
  - In case you want to download just a compiler:
